# Two Hour Workshop Materials

- Variables and data types
- Functions, scope, closures, anonymous functions (IIFE)
- Logic and loops
- Object literals and DOM, prototypes

Each section can be done in 30 minutes, so you can do a two hour workshop, or break them up into half-hour bits and do them at a user group meeting or project night.

# Coach Guidelines

Help your volunteer coaches make the best environment for your attendees. These are the guidelines I've used in other workshops.

1. Do not touch someone else's computer without asking permission.

You need to ask before you enter someone's space, so no touching keyboards without asking. It's better for learners if they do most of the driving. If you really need to, something like "May I drive?" always works for me.

2. Students get frustrated. Give them space.

Confusion is frustrating. If someone is getting frustrated, give them space to calm down. Strangely enough, saying things like "You're doing fine" is not helpful -- things that recognize and acknowledge the situation are helpful, like "It IS hard. Is there another way you'd like to look at it?" and after you do an activity "What did you think of that?" "Did that help you understand X? What's unclear?" If it's something that's out of your scope of experience, do NOT keep trying to help, find someone who might know more than you to help out.

3. Answer questions, but respect the space

In a classroom setting, it's easy when you're helping a student to either accidentally let them get behind, or send them off a tangent ... and be careful that you aren't being disruptive to everyone else, such as if a lecture portion is starting after an interactive portion.
