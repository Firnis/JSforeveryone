# Two Hour Workshop Materials

- Variables and data types
- Functions, scope, closures, anonymous functions (IIFE)
- Logic and loops
- Object literals and DOM, prototypes

Each section can be done in 30 minutes, so you can do a two hour workshop, or break them up into half-hour bits and do them at a user group meeting or project night. The presentation is using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
